# Calculate Carrier Cross Sections
## Installation
### Dependencies
#### HPC System
The code is compiled using GNU-based compilers mpif90 and gfortran. If your system uses wrappers for those compilers, you will need to designate that in the main Makefile.
You will also need to have a GNU environment and an OpenMPI module loaded.

#### Local machine 
Code dependencies and git (commands given for Unix environment):
```
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt install gfortran
sudo apt install libmpich-dev
sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev
sudo apt-get install git
```

Documentation dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install ford
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

### Set up Quantum Espresso
On your local system, you can use, `sudo wget https://github.com/QEF/q-e/archive/qe-5.3.tar.gz` to download QE 5.3. For other versions, you will need to change the link
acccordingly. On an HPC system, you will need to download the source directly and use some form of `scp` or a file-transfer client to get the source to the HPC system.

Once you have the code downloaded (example commands given for QE 5.3 only):
* Change to whatever directory you saved the QE tar file in on the CLI
* Decompress the tar file using `tar -xvzf q-e-qe-5.3.tar.gz`
* Confirm modules: `PrgEnv-gnu`, some version of OpenMPI, some version of fftw
* Change into the QE directory and run `./configure`
* Confirm that the last line of output is `configure: success`
* Edit the `make.sys` file:
  * `DFLAGS = -D__FFTW -D__MPI`
  * Make sure `MPIF90`, `F90`, and `CPP` match your system's wrappers for `mpif90`, `gfortran`, and `cc`
  * Add `-dynamic` (and `-fopenmp` if you want OpenMP enabled) to `FFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`
  * Vreify paths for `BLAS_LIBS` and `LAPACK_LIBS`
* Run `make pw pp ph` to build the PW, PP, and PHonon packages. You need `pw` and `pp` for the Export program dependencies, and LSF calculations require input from the 
  `ph` package.

### Download and Compile Source

#### Connecting to Git Using an SSH Key
* Log in to the machine you want the local copy of the repo to live on
* Generate an SSH key using `ssh-keygen`, hitting enter at each of the prompts
* Your public SSH key will be stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
* Log in to your profile on a web browser and go to settings
* Select "SSH and GPG keys"
* Click new SSH key and copy and paste the contents of the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file into the large text box, adding a name to the smaller box above, if desired
* You can now clone a git repo from this machine using ssh (see [Forking and Cloning the Repo and Compiling](#forking-and-cloning-the-repo-and-compiling))

#### Forking and Cloning the Repo and Compiling
* First, go the the main repo on a web browser and fork it using the fork button at the top right
* You will now have a copy of the repo under your username
* Clone the repo on the machine of your choice using ssh (must have ssh key set up; see [Connecting to Git Using an SSH Key](#connecting-to-git-using-an-ssh-key)):
```
git clone git@github.com:<your git username>/defectCrossSections.git
```
* Change into the `defectCrossSections` directory
* Open the `Makefile` and edit the path(s) to Quantum Espresso and the compilers to match your system 

_Note: Make sure that your path does not have a `/` at the end or there will be an error_
* You should now be able to make the target you want (e.g., to compile everything, use `make`)
* For a list of some possible targets, read through the `Makefile` or type `make help`

## Contributing
* First, make sure that you have the repo forked and cloned (see [Forking and Cloning the Repo and Compiling](#forking-and-cloning-the-repo-and-compiling))
* You will make changes on your local copy, push them to your origin, and submit a pull request to the main repo
* For more information on using git, see [Quick Git Guide](quickGitGuide.md)
